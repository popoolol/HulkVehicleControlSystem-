# HulkVehicleControlSystem-
This is the repository consisting of the code for the systems of the Hulk. The "Hulk" is a 3D printing robot with the ability to print on curved surfaces i.e like a cylinder or a sphere. From the computer vision system for the Hulk to the motor control system. This will include all of the systems required to run the Hulk.
The readme at least at the start will be open to any format
when adding what we are working on we should add commit messages
there are a lot of commit message formats out there but for now just make it as descriptive as possible
pls add a section to the readme when you include the file you have been working on:
For example:
    Section: "Section name"
    Author: "author name"
    Description: "Short description of file or files included"
